    With reference to one of the problem sets.

    The greatest common divisor of two integers is the largest number that divides them both evenly. For example, gcd(12, 18) = 6, gcd(âˆ’4, 14) = 2. The most efficient way to compute gcd is with the Euclidean algorithm. Write a program with a function to compute gcd for two integers. Try doing the function without recursion first - it will help you understand how the algorithm works.
    Explicitly define your sub-tasks, for example, find the code for the Euclidean algorithm; create a non-recursive function for the algorithm; etc.
